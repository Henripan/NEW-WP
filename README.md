### 1. Introduction
miRTIGO is a novel miRNA target predictor, designed to identify sample-specific miRNA targets by  analyzing the same-sample miRNA-mRNA expression profiles. It decomposes the biological procedure behind miRNA targeting into two independent stages: contacting and binding. Approximating the contacting stage by a random collision model, and the efficiency of the binding stage by sequence matching scores of RNAs, miRTIGO models endogenous RNA competition explicitly in a global scale and outputs an miRTIGO signature matrix to measure the relative activity of each individual miRNA-mRNA interactions.

#### 1.1 Purpose of this algorithm
miRTIGO was developed by professional oncologists and statisticians to help researchers with insufficient programing skills to efficiently and accurately identify context-specific targets for miRNAs. As a unique feature of miRTIGO, giving sample-specific predictions enables researchers to explore the biological mechanisms of the miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulatory network when samples are limited (e.g. rare tumor samples) or even in individual samples (e.g. single cells, exosome samples).

### 2. Executing miRTIGO
####  2.1 Files required
In order to run the current version of miRTIGO, the users should provide two data files describing the expression levels of each miRNA and mRNA in a sample, respectively. And one additional file describing the correspondence of samples between the miRNA and mRNA data files. All files are tab-delimited ASCII text files and must comply with the following specifications:

1.**Input miRNA/mRNA file** is organized as follows:<br>
![test](https://github.com/Henripan/Wepro/blob/master/input%20miRNA%20file.png)<br>
![test](https://github.com/Henripan/Wepro/blob/master/input%20mRNA%20file.png)<br>

The first line contains the labels Name followed by the identifiers for each sample in the dataset. <br>
>Line format: `Name(tab)(sample 1 name)(tab)(sample 2 name) (tab) ... (sample N name)`<br>
>Example: `miRNAName	sample_1	sample_2	...	sample_N`<br>

The remainder of the file contains data for each of the miRNAs/mRNAs. There is one line for each miRNA/mRNA. Each line contains the miRNA/mRNA name and a value for each sample in the dataset.<br>

2.**Sample-to-sample file** generally contains two columns, which shows the corresponding relationship of the sample identifiers in mirna expression file and mrna expression file. It also serves as a index to denote which samples we choose to analyze. It is organized as follows:<br>
![test](https://github.com/Henripan/Wepro/blob/master/sample-to-sample.png)<br>

The first line must contain the label Names for samples in each expression dataset with the first column for miRNA and second column for mRNA. <br>
>Line format: `(sample name in miRNA file)(tab)(sample name in mRNA file)`<br>
>Example: `sample_miRNA	sample_mRNA`<br>

The remainder of the file contains sample identifiers used in the miRNA and mRNA expression files. There is one line for each sample. Each line contains the identifiers for that sample.<br>

#### 2.2 Script Execution<br>

miRTIGO is written in R. Thus the users first need to download and install the R software on the platform (refer to [https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/) for details). [The code](https://github.com/Henripan/Wepro/blob/master/Test1.txt) of miRTIGO consists of three parts, namely, 'FUNCTIONS', 'DATA INPUT' and 'EXECUTION'. The users only need to focus on the 'DATA INPUT' part and fill in the relevant files described as follows:<br>

>214 mrna = as.matrix(read.table("`mrna_list.txt`", head = TRUE, sep = "\t"))<br>
>215 mirna = as.matrix(read.table("`mirna_list.txt`", head = TRUE, sep = "\t"))<br>
>216 CWCS_matrix1 = as.matrix(read.table("`wMRE_all.txt`", head = TRUE, sep = "\t"))<br>

Those three files serve as the basis to define the sequence matching scores between miRNAs and mRNAs, which are compiled from [TargetScan](http://www.targetscan.org/vert_70/) and provided [here](https://github.com/Henripan/Wepro/blob/master/Test3.txt). 

>223 name_cancer = as.matrix(read.table("`Sample-to-sample.txt`", head = TRUE, sep = "\t"))<br>
>224 mirna_cancer = as.matrix(read.table("`Input miRNA expression.txt`", head = FALSE, sep = "\t"))<br>
>225 mrna_cancer = as.matrix(read.table("`Input mRNA expression.txt`", head = FALSE, sep = "\t"))<br>

Those three files should be provided by the users, which contains the paired expression profiles of miRNAs and mRNAs of the samples that they are interested in.

All these files must be in the same folder as the [miRTIGO code](https://github.com/Henripan/Wepro/blob/master/Test1.txt), in order for the program to execute correctly.

>227 `thres_num = 5000`<br>

The 'thres_num' is the number of top rankers that users are interested in. By choosing 5000 miRTIGO will output the top 5000 ranked miRNA-mRNA interactions.<br>

### 3. Reproduction of the miRTIGO paper`s experiments<br>
1. The codes to reproduce these experiments in this paper were written in R and should be executed in the corresponding software environment.<br> 
2. Generally, all these codes are arranged into three parts as 'FUNCTIONS', 'INPUT DATA' and 'EXECUTION'. The users need to download and fill in the relevant input files before implementing corresponding analyses.<br>
3. Files required for the reproduction of the experiments can be broadly divided into three categories:<br>

* Files for executing the algorithms (BASIC DATA)<br>

	| File Name | Descriptions | 
	| :-------------: |:-------------| 
	| wMRE\_all.txt | _cumulative weighted context++ scores_ between an miRNA and mRNA |
	| qMRE\_all.txt | number of target sites (MREs) on one mRNA for one miRNA |
	| conserved\_qMRE.txt | number of conserved target sites on one mRNA for one miRNA|
	| mirna\_list.txt | miRNA identifiers |
	| mrna\_list.txt | mRNA identifiers |

	All these files are compiled from TargetScan v7.0.



* Files for evaluation analyses (EVALUATION DATA)<br>
	* Experimentally confirmed miRNA-mRNA interactions (MMIs)<br>

	| miRNA biomarkers | miRNAs that are significantly correlated with tumor development, tumor staging, tumor grade and patient survival | 288 |
	| Cancer genes | COSMIC database | 616 |

All files listed above can be found in a compressed file [here](). Detailed description of these files is provided in the Supplementary Note of the paper.<br>
